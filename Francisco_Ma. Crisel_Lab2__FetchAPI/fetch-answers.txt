1. What are the main differences between XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API?
- XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is older and uses callback functions, making code harder to read and maintain.
- Fetch API is newer, promiseâ€‘based, and provides cleaner syntax.
- Fetch returns a Promise automatically, while XHR requires manually handling ready states.

2. Why is the Fetch API considered more modern and readable?
- Because it uses Promises (and can use async/await), making the code simpler and easier to follow compared to XHR.
- It avoids nested callbacks and allows chaining.

3. What is the purpose of the .then() and .catch() methods in Fetch?
- .then() handles the successful response and processes the returned data.
- .catch() handles errors, such as network issues or failed responses.

4. What happens when you send a POST request to the placeholder API?
- The API accepts the request and returns a fake/placeholder response and does not actually store the data permanently.
