1. What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?
- readyState shows the progress of the request (0–4), while status shows the HTTP response code.
  readyState values:
    0 – Request not initialized
    1 – Connection established
    2 – Request received
    3 – Processing request
    4 – Request finished and response ready
  status values:
    200 – Success
    404 – Not Found
    500 – Server Error

2. How can you make the request asynchronous?
- By setting the third argument in xhr.open() to true:
    xhr.open("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1", true);

3. Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?
- It allows the web page to remain responsive while waiting for a server response.
- The user can still interact with the page without freezing or delays.
- This improves performance and user experience.
